// In the App component, you're using the Container component twice with different sets of props and children:

// In the first Container, you provide a header prop with the value "Example header" and a direction prop with the value "horizontal." You also include multiple <div> elements as children.

// In the second Container, you provide a header prop with the value "Example header," a textPosition prop with the value "center," and you include multiple <img> elements as children.

// The Container component uses these props to style and arrange its content based on the specified configuration.

// Overall, the Container component is a flexible container that can adjust its styling and layout based on the provided props, making it versatile for various use cases.
